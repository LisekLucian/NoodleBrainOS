## What is NoodleBrain OS?

NoodleBrain OS is not your average operating system. It's a symphony of spaghetti code, a dance of absurdity, and a journey into the heart of silliness. Embrace the chaos, and let your computer join the noodle revolution! Or else.

## Features

- üçù **Spaghetti Code Architecture:** Our code is so tangled, it makes your grandma's secret pasta recipe look like child's play.
  
- üé∂ **Rhythmic Updates:** Version 404 dances to the beat of life's eighth notes. Expect surprises, giggles, and the occasional tap-dancing bug.

- üåà **Whimsical Wonderland License:** Dive into a world of freedom, fun, and frolic. Just remember to share the laughter!
